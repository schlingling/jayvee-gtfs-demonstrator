# GTFS Demonstrator for Jayvee
This is a demonstrator to showcase and validate GTFS-related extensions of [Jayvee](https://github.com/jvalue/jayvee), a domain specific language for data engineering.

The demonstrator is part of my master thesis "TBD".

# Development quickstart
1. Run `npm i` to install the dependencies.
2. Run `npx nodemon` to start the development server with hot reload.

# Resources
Folder `./resources/` contains GTFS static and realtime data from the metropolis region around the city of Brest (details about the resource can be found at [French NAP](https://transport.data.gouv.fr/resources/43286). This region, with a population of around 140,000 and 1062 bus stops, provides an excellent example to showcase the capabilities of the system. All files within the folder are captured at the same point of time to have a static point to run the experiment.
